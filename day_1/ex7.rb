#prints a string, pretty straightforward.
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
#prints a string with a string inside of it.
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
#prints the string "." 10 times.
puts "." * 10

#The following 12 lines create 12 variables, each a character in the string "CheeseBurger"
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

#"CheeseBurger" is printed. The command 'print' doesn't start a new line (unlike
#'puts')and therefore it isn't broken up by a line break.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
