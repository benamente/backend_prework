# Welcome To My Pre-work Projects

I thought you might want a quick overview of what you're looking at.

## cryp_solver

I'd say about 80% of the time I've spent coding before Mod 1 starts I've spent on this project.
In terms of organization, there was analysis paralysis, so I eventually sort of gave up on that front and figured I would learn more about how to organize a program at Turing and at a faster rate than I could on my own.  

One thing that I tried to implement, but couldn't quite reach, was a binary search tree for past guesses. Excited to learn the right way I might solve this problem and others at Turing!


## The Village
There's no README, but when you run it it explains itself.  

 I wrote it on c9 before I was accepted to Turing. It's not very object oriented, or very Ruby / there's a ton of global variables.

 Designing it was a fun way to dip my toe into using Ruby.

## Others
Skeleton is from Learn Ruby The Hard Way's lesson on organizing program files. Ngrams is from a tutorial on ngrams in ruby, pry_practice from a tutorial on pry. Test_writer is something I made to write rake tests from coupled lines of code + line of expected result.

## That's all
Thanks for browsing my pre-work projects. Excited for mod one to start!
